## Description

This is a mock website for a client and friend of mine. I built it as a SEO using only HTML, Vanilla CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. I implemented a little jQuery so the site would appear to be a one page application. The code is clean and uses best practices (with the exception of the image files being in strict jpeg format). It scored a SEO 100 when I ran a Lighthouse audit, and the UI is polished and mobile responsive. I wanted to get as close to "React.js" functionality as possible, and feel very good about the outcome.

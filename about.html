        Do people really read the “about me” pages on websites? Probably not,
        but just in case, here is my “about me” page. What I think I will do is
        use it to answer the question that people most often ask me…how did I
        develop this specialization in drummer photography?<br /><br />
        Years ago, more years than I will admit to, I met Modern Drummer’s
        associate editor Billy Amendola at a Ringo concert. Billy needed
        pictures of Ringo playing the drums so minutes before the concert began
        he made his way down to the photo pit and out of about eight or nine
        photographers in there, by sheer luck of the draw, decided to approach
        me. He introduced himself to me and explained what he was looking for. I
        told him not to get his hopes up because we, the professional
        photographers, were only permitted to shoot the first three songs, Ringo
        wouldn’t be playing the drums until the fifth song. Unfortunately I was
        right and all I was able to provide him with were pictures of Ringo
        air-drumming…fun, but not what he needed. But a couple of things came
        out of this chance encounter…Billy and I became friends and I became
        acutely aware of the person in the band who is surrounded by the most
        glorious gear of anyone else on stage…the guy who, pound for pound,
        exhibits more emotion per square inch of playing area than any other
        member of the band…I’m speaking, of course, about the drummer.<br /><br />
        Fast forward those x-amount of years and I’m pleased to say that I have
        developed a specialization in drummer photography, regularly working
        with many of the USA and European drum publications. Several years ago I
        was asked by Modern Drummer to help them start a new column. You’ve
        probably seen it…“Gearing Up” (I’m the one who came up with the name). I
        hit the ground running, not only photographing drummers, but
        interviewing them as well, specifically about their gear. It didn’t take
        too many interviews for me to realize that I was ill-equipped to do
        this, having little knowledge about <i>playing</i> the drums. So I did
        the only sensible thing, I started to take drum lessons.<br /><br />
        After a few years of lessons, I’m still nowhere near pro-ficient (get
        it?), but my drumming ability is adequate enough for me to put the
        headphones on and rock out to some of my favorite songs (that typical
        interview question ‘what CDs did you practice to when you were first
        learning to play drums’ has taken on new meaning for me). I started my
        drum lessons thinking it would be a necessary chore and wound up
        enjoying the heck out it. I think part of the reason that I love it so
        much is because there is absolutely no one relying on me for my drumming
        prowess, I play completely for fun and just for me. But thanks to my
        teacher, Mark Poiesz, I have developed an “ear” and while I don’t have
        talent to replicate all that I hear, I can understand and visualize the
        drum patterns and fully appreciate the artistry that is necessary be a
        drummer. Needless to say, the lessons have also improved my interviews
        (I now write feature stories) and it has helped my photography. For
        example, when I want that great ‘into the hi-hat’ shot, I ask my
        drummers to play the beginning of “Suspicious Minds.” In other words,
        because I now know what kit components are being played I can better
        direct the drummer during a photo session in order to get the shots that
        I’m looking for.<br /><br />
        In case you’re still reading this and you aren’t a drummer, I have come
        to discover that my cameras also work on guitar and bass players,
        keyboard players, lead vocalists and other band members. They seem to
        work on just about everything.<br /><br />
        When given a photographic assignment, my goal is to attain the best,
        most authentic images possible. I want to provide my clients with
        compelling images or, as I’m fond of saying, images that they can
        hear.<br /><br />
        It might surprise you to learn that I have an MBA, I’m a marketing
        specialist and I minored in English…in other words, I’m no empty
        chair.<br /><br />
        Whether you’re a musician, a manufacturer, a publicist or just someone
        that wants to arrange an opportunity to make some wonderful pictures, I
        can help you. Most multi-pose, single location shoots are $1600 (prices
        might be higher or lower based on usage), Nashville Drummers get a
        substantial discount. Call me at 954-292-7938 or email
